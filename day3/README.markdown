# Day 3

## Special Notes

This implementation requires modifying the constant `BIT_LENGTH` to maximum bit length of the rows in the data that is being processed. For example, if you process the sample data set, each bit string has a length of 5, whereas in the actual data set each bit string has a length of 12.
