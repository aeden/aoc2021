# My Advent of Code 2021 Solutions in C++

Some of us at [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com) are doing the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) together.

I chose to implement my solutions in C++ as I want to learn the language.

## Compiling

You can compile any example by changing into the directory for the day and using `c++ -o bin/filename filename.cpp`.

## Running

You can run any example by changing into the directory for the day and using `bin/filename [arg]`.

## References

Here are some of the sites I'm learning from:

[TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm)
[cplusplus](https://www.cplusplus.com/)

Plus a lot of searching on Duck Duck Go.
