# My Advent of Code 2021 Solutions in C++ and Clojure

Some of us at [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com) are doing the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) together.

I chose to implement my solutions in C++ as I want to learn the language.

I also chose to re-implement some solutions in Clojure as I want to brush up on the language.

## Compiling

You can compile any C++ example by changing into the directory for the day and using `c++ -o bin/filename src/filename.cpp`.

## Running

You can run any C++ example by changing into the directory for the day and using `bin/filename args` where args are pairs like `:filename data.txt`..

You can run any Clojure example by changing into the directory for the day and using `clj -X packagename/run` where package name is the name of the source file without the `.clj` extension. For example, in day1 you'd run `clj -X p1/run` to run the first part of the problem from day 1. 

## References

Here are some of the sites I'm learning C++ from:

* [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm)
* [cplusplus](https://www.cplusplus.com/)

Plus a lot of searching on Duck Duck Go.
